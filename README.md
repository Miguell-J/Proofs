# üìò Mathematical Proof Notebook

This repository is a personal, living document of mathematical proofs that I am studying, solving, and formalizing over time using LaTeX. The goal is to build a comprehensive and rigorous compendium of proofs ‚Äî ranging from foundational results in number theory and real analysis to advanced topics in topology, algebra, logic, quantum theory, and computational complexity.

## üìå Purpose

The notebook serves as:

- A **training ground** for improving proof-writing skills and mathematical maturity.
- A **reference** for reviewing key theorems across multiple fields of pure and applied mathematics.
- A **long-term project** that will evolve alongside my academic journey ‚Äî from undergraduate studies to potential research-level contributions.

## üìö Topics Covered

The document is structured into two main sections:

### 1. Easy‚ÄìMedium‚ÄìHard (Undergraduate to Early Graduate Level)

- Parity and number theory
- Rationality/irrationality
- Set theory and functions
- Limits, continuity, sequences, and series (Œµ‚ÄìŒ¥ proofs)
- Linear algebra and orthogonality
- Topology: open/closed sets, compactness
- Group theory and transformations
- Fundamental results in analysis
- Hilbert spaces and operator theory
- Complexity classes (P, NP, coNP)
- Basic algebraic topology (homology, homotopy)

### 2. Insane (Graduate/Research Level)

- Riemann Hypothesis and prime counting error terms
- Fundamental group of the torus and genus classification
- Category theory in quantum mechanics (monoidal categories)
- Hodge conjecture (special cases in CP¬≤)
- Thurston‚Äôs geometrization via Seifert fiberings
- Hamiltonian cycles under P = NP
- Spectral theory of compact self-adjoint operators
- Stable homotopy groups of spheres
- Topos theory and Peano axioms in internal logic
- Persistent homology and causal set theory

## üõ† Structure

- `main.tex`: The main LaTeX source file.
- `proofs.pdf`: The compiled version (updated as progress is made).

## ‚úÖ Progress

I am currently adding proofs incrementally, starting from the most fundamental and working toward the "insane" section. Each proof is written with formal rigor, often including definitions, lemmas, and clean mathematical exposition.

You can track progress by the number of solved theorems in the PDF. A progress checklist will be added soon.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Compile

Make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed, such as:

- [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
- [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)
- [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com/) (for cloud editing)

## üí° Future Plans

* Add clickable index and table of contents
* Split proofs by subject (Analysis, Algebra, Topology, etc.)
* Include diagrams using TikZ
* Add bibliography and references per topic
* Publish an online version (via GitHub Pages or arXiv-style PDF)
* Translate to Portuguese (optional)

## ü§ù Contributions

This is a personal project, but I'm open to:

* Suggestions for new problems
* Alternative proofs for theorems
* Feedback on rigor, style, or notation

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
