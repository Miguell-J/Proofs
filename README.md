# Proofs
This repository is a personal document of mathematical proofs that I am studying, solving, and formalizing over time using LaTeX. The goal is to build a comprehensive and rigorous compendium of proofs, ranging from foundational results in number theory and real analysis to advanced topics in math physics em CS theory.
